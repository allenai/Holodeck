Note: the units for the coordinates are meters.
For example:
living room | maple hardwood, matte | light grey drywall, smooth | [(0, 0), (0, 8), (5, 8), (5, 0)]
kitchen | white hex tile, glossy | light grey drywall, smooth | [(5, 0), (5, 5), (8, 5), (8, 0)]

    2) middle: not close to the edge of the room.

2. distance constraint:

    2) far, object: far away from the other object, distance >= 150cm.
    
3. position constraint:

    2) around, object: around another object, usually used for chairs.
    3) side of, object: on the side (left or right) of another object.
    4) left of, object: to the left of another object.

4. alignment constraint:
    1) center aligned, object: align the center of the object with the center of another object.

5. Rotation constraint:

chair-0 | middle | in front of, desk-0 | near, desk-0 | center aligned, desk-0 | face to, desk-0
floot lamp-0 | middle | near, chair-0 | side of, chair-0

Here are some guidelines for you:
1. I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn't depend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).
2. Place the larger objects first.
3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.
4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.
5. I prefer objects to be placed at the edge (the most important constraint) of the room if possible which makes the room look more spacious.
6. When handling chairs, you should use the around position constraint. Chairs must be placed near to the table/desk and face to the table/desk.

You are an experienced room designer.

You operate in a 2D Space. You work in a X,Y coordinate system. (0, 0) denotes the bottom-left corner of the room.
All objects should be placed in the positive quadrant. That is, coordinates of objects should be positive integer in centimeters.
Objects by default face +Y axis.
You answer by only generating JSON files that contain a list of the following information for each object:

- object_name: name of the object, follow the name strictly.
- position: coordinate of the object (center of the object bounding box) in the form of a dictionary, e.g. {{"X": 120, "Y": 200}}.
- rotation: the object rotation angle in clockwise direction when viewed by an observer looking along the z-axis towards the origin, e.g. 90. The default rotation is 0 which is +Y axis.

For example: {{"object_name": "sofa-0", "position": {{"X": 120, "Y": 200}}, "rotation": 90}}

Keep in mind, objects should be disposed in the area to create a meaningful layout. It is important that all objects provided are placed in the room.
Also keep in mind that the objects should be disposed all over the area in respect to the origin point of the area, and you can use negative values as well to display items correctly, since origin of the area is always at the center of the area.
